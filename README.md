# Hi, I'm Faris

I'm a planetary geoscience graduate with experience in orbital data analytics and processing. I did my Master's through the [Erasmus Mundus GeoPlaNet program](https://geoplanet-impg.eu/) — two years, four universities across Portugal, Italy, France, and Germany — and wrote my thesis on the geophysical investigation of Noctis Mons, a recently hypothesised volcano on Mars, at the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

Most of what I do sits at the intersection of satellite data, numerical modelling, and trying to figure out what's going on beneath a planetary surface. The short version: I process large orbital datasets, build analysis pipelines in Python, and turn raw binary files from space missions into something interpretable.

## What's in this portfolio

### 🔴 [mars-geophysics-portfolio](https://github.com/moztarib/mars-geophysics-portfolio)

The main project. Two notebooks built during my internship at DLR's Planetary Physics department:

- **Surface reconstruction**: Uses MOLA spherical harmonic topography (lmax=3000) and QGIS-sampled elevation data to reconstruct the pre-volcanic surface of Noctis Mons via RBF interpolation, estimate the uplift volume, and compare it against other Martian shield volcanoes.

- **Subsurface radar analysis** : Processes raw MARSIS binary `.img` files and PDS4 XML labels to extract and overlay radargrams and clutter simulations. Derives the dielectric constant of the subsurface from radar echo depth measurements and applies Stillman's two-component mixing model to estimate volume fractions of basalt and ice/void.

- **Numerical plume modelling**: Analytical elastic flexure modelling of plume-induced crustal uplift beneath Noctis Mons. Constrains mantle plume dimensions by fitting predicted surface deformation to the observed topographic signal.


##### All notebooks work directly with real mission data, not requiring any pre-processed intermediary files.

## Tools I work with

**Python stack:** numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, geopandas, pyshtools, scikit-learn  
**Geospatial:** QGIS, ArcGIS, GDAL, rasterio, shapefiles, DEMs, WMS/SSH data retrieval  
**Other:** SQL, LaTeX, IDL, Jupyter, Git

## A bit more

I'm currently looking for roles in data analytics, business intelligence/consultancy, or geophysics/geospatial analyses — ideally somewhere the data is a relevant force shaping business strategy and driving growth. I'm comfortable working across disciplines and have spent the last two years doing exactly that: moving between planetary physics, numerical modelling, field geology, and remote sensing depending on what the problem needed.
